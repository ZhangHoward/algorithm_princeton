# Summary
* Union Find
  * Union 2 elements at a time. Check amongst n elements, if 2 elements are connected. 
* Weighted Quick Union data structure implementation
  * **union(a, b)** connects two element. It merges the root of smaller tree to the root of bigger tree. **Time complexity: O(n)**, where n is the total number of elements.
  * **connected(a, b)** checks if two elements are connected. If checks if 2 elements have the same root. **Time complexity: O(n)**, where n is the total number of elements.
* Percolation application of Union Find.
